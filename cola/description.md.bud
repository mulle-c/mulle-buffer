mulle-buffer can construct arbitrary long binary data dynamically or in static
storage. You don't have to worry about calculating the necessary buffer size.
It's easy, fast and safe. It can also be used as a stream and it is used to
implement NSMutableData. mulle-buffer has functions to create hexdumps and
quoted C string output.

With [mulle-fprintf](//github.com/mulle-core/mulle_fprintf), you can use
`printf` style formatting and create string concatenations without
having to worry about memory management.
